This directory contains 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings project created in C programming

Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What are pointers and how to use them
    What are arrays and how to use them
    What are the differences between pointers and arrays
    How to use strings and how to manipulate them
    Scope of variables

Below are functions and programms created in the project

0-strcat.c - This function concatenates two strings. This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte and returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

1-strncat.c - This function  concatenates two strings. The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

2-strncpy.c - This function copies a string.

3-strcmp.c - This function compares two strings.

4-rev_array.c - This function reverses the content of an array of integers.

5-string_toupper.c - This function changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

6-cap_string.c - This function capitalizes all words of a string.

7-leet.c - This function encodes a string into 1337.

100-rot13.c -This function encodes a string using rot13.

101-print_number.c - This function prints an integer.

102-magic.c - This program prints a[2] = 98

103-infinite_add.c - This function adds two numbers.

104-print_buffer.c - This function prints a buffer.
